# Testing the Authorization Fix

## What Was Fixed

The 403 "This action is unauthorized" error was occurring because the API expects the `session_id` from conversations, not the conversation `id`. 

From the API documentation and logs:
- Each conversation has both an `id` and a `session_id`
- The messages endpoint requires the `session_id`: `/projects/{projectId}/conversations/{session_id}/messages`
- Example: Conversation ID `5055128` has `session_id: "5055127"`

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Conversation Type**: Added `session_id` field to the Conversation interface
2. **Fixed API Client**: Updated message endpoints to use `session_id` instead of conversation `id`
3. **Added Fallback**: Implemented local message storage as a fallback when API fails
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track the issue

## How to Test

1. **Refresh the Browser** (Important: Clear cache with Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
   
2. **Open Debug Logs**: Click "Debug Logs" in the sidebar to monitor

3. **Test Previous Conversations**:
   - Select an agent
   - Click on an existing conversation
   - Check if messages load successfully

4. **Check the Logs**: Look for:
   - `sessionId` being logged alongside `conversationId`
   - Status 200 responses instead of 403 errors
   - "Using cached messages as fallback" if API still fails

## Expected Behavior

- New conversations should work (they already did)
- Old conversations should now load messages successfully
- If API still returns 403, cached messages should be displayed

## If Issues Persist

1. Check that conversation objects include `session_id` field
2. Verify the session_id is being used in the URL (check Network tab)
3. Look for any TypeScript errors in the console
4. Share the latest logs from the Debug page

## Note

The fix addresses the root cause: using the wrong ID for the messages endpoint. The API requires the session_id, not the conversation id.
