# Analytics Dashboard Usage Guide

## Problem Fixed

The 404 error you were seeing was caused by the analytics page trying to redirect to home when no agent was selected. I've fixed this with the following improvements:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

1. **Graceful Agent Handling**: Analytics page now shows a proper "No Agent Selected" screen instead of redirecting
2. **Mock Data Fallback**: When API endpoints aren't available, the page shows mock analytics data
3. **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages and warnings

## üöÄ How to Test the Analytics Dashboard

### Step 1: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Access the Application
Visit: http://localhost:3002 (or the port shown in your terminal)

### Step 3: Set Up API Key
1. If you haven't already, enter your CustomGPT API key
2. The key should be in format: `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Step 4: Create/Select an Agent
1. Either create a new agent using the "Create New Agent" button
2. Or select an existing agent from the dropdown in the top navigation

### Step 5: Navigate to Analytics
1. Click on "Analytics" in the left sidebar
2. Or navigate directly to http://localhost:3002/analytics

## üìä What You'll See

The analytics dashboard includes:

### Performance Metrics Cards
- Total Conversations
- Total Queries  
- Unique Users
- Average Response Time

### Interactive Charts
- Conversation trends over time (Line Chart)
- Query volume over time (Line Chart)
- Top queries (Bar Chart)
- Traffic statistics

### Features
- Date range picker (24/06/2025 - 24/07/2025)
- Refresh button to reload data
- Export functionality (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### Mock Data Notice
If you see a warning "Using mock analytics data - API unavailable", this means:
- The API endpoints aren't responding (which is expected for development)
- The dashboard is showing realistic sample data instead
- All functionality still works for testing purposes

## üîß Expected Behavior

1. **With Agent Selected**: Shows full analytics dashboard with charts and data
2. **Without Agent**: Shows "No Agent Selected" screen with option to go home
3. **API Unavailable**: Shows mock data with warning toast

## üêõ If You Still See Issues

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools and check for any JavaScript errors
3. **Check Network Tab**: See if there are any failed requests
4. **Verify Agent Selection**: Make sure an agent is properly selected in the dropdown

## üéØ Next Steps

The analytics dashboard is now working with mock data. Once your CustomGPT API endpoints for analytics are available, the dashboard will automatically use real data instead of mock data.

The analytics dashboard should now load properly and show meaningful data for testing and development!
