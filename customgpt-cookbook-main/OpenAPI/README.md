# CustomGPT's REST API OpenAPI Description

This repository contains [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) descriptions for [CustomGPT's REST API](https://docs.customgpt.ai/reference/i-api-homepage).

## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.
